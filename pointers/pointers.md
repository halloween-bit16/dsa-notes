### Why pointers in C programming?

1. Efficient memory access : allows direct access to memory locations ; enables manipulation of data using memory address.

2. Function argument handling : enables call by reference ; allows functions to modify original variables passed as arguments.

3. Dynamic memory allocation : used with functions like malloc(), calloc(), free() for runtime memory management.

4. Efficient array and string handling : arrays and strings are passed as pointers, avoiding copying large data.

5. Building complex data structures : essential for creating linked lists, trees, graphs and other dynamic structures.

6. Low-level system porgramming : critical in systems programming, embedded systems and interfacing with hardware.
